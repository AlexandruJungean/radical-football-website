---

## üß≠ **CORE PRINCIPLES**

### Affective Navigation
- **State-based UX**: Navigate by emotional states, not traditional menus
- **Non-linear exploration**: Allow pauses, breaks, and circular movement
- **Symbolic interaction**: Consistent visual language for key concepts
- **Pedagogical imperfection**: Embrace raw, unpolished spaces as part of learning

### Mandatory Design Elements
These are **not errors** - they are intentional emotional and pedagogical spaces:
- **Raw Journal** (üß±) - Unfinished reflections from real collaborations
- **"I Don't Understand"** (üôä) - Confusion without shame, no answers
- **"The Lantern Went Out"** (üåë) - Loss of meaning, burnout moments
- **"Reflection Blocked"** (üîí) - When resources don't help, name that pause
- **"Impossible Question"** (üõë) - Anonymous space for unspeakable concerns
- **"Waiting Without Progress"** (‚è≥) - Stillness is allowed, time is not a mistake
- **"What I Got Wrong"** (üîÅ) - Relearning through error, not guilt
